# Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on the detection of Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. The implementation includes a Jupyter notebook (`Parkinson's Disease Detection.ipynb`) that demonstrates the entire process from data exploration to model training and evaluation.

## Project Files

1. **Parkinson's Disease Detection.ipynb**
   - This Jupyter notebook contains the main code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

2. **parkinsons.csv**
   - The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- Install necessary libraries using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
### Running the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sujoychandradas/Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-using-ML.git
    cd Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-using-ML

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
      ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Parkinson's Disease Detection.ipynb"
3. Execute each cell in the notebook to explore, preprocess, train the model, and make predictions.

### Customization and Experimentation
Feel free to experiment with the code, tweak hyperparameters, or explore other machine-learning algorithms to improve the model's performance.
